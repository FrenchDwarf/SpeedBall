**Speed Ball** is a 3D balancing game where you control a ball on a constantly tipping platform. You add some force in the direction of your choice by facing that way and clicking.

This repository contains a `Playable Build - PC` folder, feel free to clone the repository and try out the game for yourself.

### Gameplay ###

#### _Video_ ####

- Take a look at the gameplay video [here](https://youtu.be/kMFRjwT9TMk "Link to the Youtube video").

#### _Spawn Types_ ####

- **Point** balls are dropped fairly regularly, collide with them to collect the point.
- **Bonus** balls are dropped a bit more rarely, colliding with them will give you a 5 second boost to your timer.

#### _Platform_ ####

- The platform is pointing towards a circular motion along one of it's horizontal axes, which means it's constantly tipping.

### Project ###

#### _Code_ ####

- This project was made in Unity 5.3 in C#.
- This is released under the MIT License so feel free to clone the repository and open the `SpeedBall` folder in Unity to look or edit.

#### _Physics_ ####

- The physics are accomplished using Unity's built-in Rigidbody system, along with its Physics Layering and layer-matrix systems.
- The interactions between the speed ball and the points and bonus balls are accomplished through a child object, to facilitate collision-detection.

#### _Art Assets_ ####

 - All the textures were made by myself in Paint & Paint.net
